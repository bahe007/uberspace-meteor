## Setup and deploy a Meteor app to uberspace.de

This repository contains a manual on how to setup a Meteor app on uberspace and a script to deploy the app. It is very basic and rough at the moment, but I hope it helps. Please feel free to improve. 

The informations are compiled mostly from the documentation of uberspace.de

The deploy script works on OSX El Capitan, I don't know if it works on other systems or OS too
